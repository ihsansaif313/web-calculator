# Simple Calculator

This project is a web-based calculator for basic arithmetic operations, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Features:
- **User  Interface**: Modern layout with buttons for numbers and operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage), plus functional buttons (AC, DEL).
- **Responsive Design**: Centered on-screen with a gradient background for an appealing look.
- **Functionality**: Input numbers and operations, view expressions, and evaluate with "=". "AC" clears input; "DEL" deletes the last character.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: Structure and layout.
- **CSS**: Styling and aesthetics.
- **JavaScript**: Button interactions and calculations.

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to use the calculator.
3. Click the buttons to input numbers and perform calculations.

## Limitations:
- Supports only basic operations.
- Uses `eval()`, which can be risky; consider safer alternatives.
- No input validation is implemented.

## Future Improvements:
- Add input validation.
- Support advanced mathematical functions.
- Enhance UI for better usability.
